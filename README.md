# Elevator Simulation

Elevator Simulation Project for Advanced Data Structures, Embedded Systems, and Networking.

## Overview

This project simulates the operation of an elevator system, focusing on efficient scheduling, movement logic, and request handling. It is designed to demonstrate principles of data structures, networking, and embedded systems by modeling how elevators respond to user requests within a building.

## Features

- **Multiple Elevator Support:** Simulate the behavior of multiple elevators within a building.
- **Request Scheduling:** Efficiently manage and schedule elevator requests from different floors.
- **Movement Logic:** Elevators move between floors, stopping for requests and handling direction changes.
- **Queue Management:** Use advanced data structures to manage requests and elevator states.
- **Extensible Design:** Easily modify simulation parameters such as the number of floors and elevators.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: (e.g., Python, C++, Java)  
- Data Structures: Queues, Priority Queues, Trees  
- Networking Concepts (if applicable): Client-server communication for remote requests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- (List any required software, libraries, or dependencies.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itaischwarz/elevator-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd elevator-simulation
   ```
3. (Install dependencies, if any.)

### Usage

1. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   (Insert command to run the simulation, e.g., python main.py)
   ```
2. Configure parameters such as the number of floors, elevators, and request generation.

## Example

```bash
# Example command to start the simulation
python main.py --floors 10 --elevators 3
```
